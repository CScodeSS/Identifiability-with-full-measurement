# Subnetwork-identifiability-with-full-measurement

These Matlab functions are created on Matlab 2021a and may not work for older versions of Matlab.

They are the implementations of the results in [1], including the graphical analysis in Theorem 3 and a simplified version of Algorithm 1 for identifiability synthesis.

Examples of how to use these functions can be found in the two main files.
